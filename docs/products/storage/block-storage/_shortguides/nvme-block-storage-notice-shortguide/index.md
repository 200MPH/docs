{{< note >}}
Our newer NVMe Block Storage solution is now available in the Atlanta (USA) and Newark (USA) data centers. This new hardware dramatically increases the performance of Block Storage and is offered at no additional cost. While all other data centers currently use a combination of NVMe storage and HDDs, NVMe-based Block Storage infrastructure upgrades will soon be deployed across our entire fleet. Review the [Block Storage Overview > Availability](/docs/products/storage/block-storage/#availability) page to learn more information about this roll out.
